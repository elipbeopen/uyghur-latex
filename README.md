# Uyghur Latex
This is a collection of several methods for uyghur latex. Through googling, I found several methods. Personally, I used the arabtex, because it is easy to use when you have few uyghur script in your documents. But if you have to type large uyghur text, I recommend you use the method from Mr. Mamat. 

#  Uyghur typesetting in Latex
Uyghur_Latex_Example is from Mr. Mamat's blog. "XeTeX now supports Arabic typesetting. It means you can typeset Uyghur in Latex. It is not as good as the professional typesetting systems. But it definitely looks much better than the MS word typesetting." Anwar Mamat

# Arabtex
The Arabtex version is from Klaus Lagally. You can check detailed information in uighur.tex file.
